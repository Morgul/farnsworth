# Farnsworth

This is a project to build a fully functional Farnsworth, from Warehouse 13. While it might seem a bit daunting, with the advent of micro computers like the Raspberry Pi, the project has reached a level where for a few hundred dollars, it's _possible_. Not exactly practical, but what the hell? Practicality isn't what this is about.

## Intentions

It is my intention to use this project to both document my progress in this project, as well as house all code or other things I find useful. By following what I put up, you should be able to repeat my success (or failure!). Also, since I'm not an expert at most of this, I welcome contributions! It doesn't have to be in code; if you're an expert in electronics and find a much better way to do what I'm doing, that'd be great! Heck, just helping keep the parts list up to date would be wonderful.

At the end of the day, I **will** have a set of working Farnsworths. It _can_ be done, and I _will_ do it. Let's see how far single-minded determination can get me, eh?

## Current Design

I'm going to be using a Raspberry Pi with the camera module. I've not decided on an LCD, power supply, or how to do audio input, yet. I also am thinking I'll use node.js for the code. (The Stream API is likely to make my life much easier.)

## More information

I highly recommend checking out the Wiki for the latest information on what I'm working on. For now, that's about all that's going to be on the project, until I start writing some test code.

## Contributions

As I said above, I would love contributions. This project is designed to be open from the begining. So, if you want to get in on some sweet, sweet Farnsworth action, please do! Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Morgul/farnsworth/issues), or the [wiki](https://github.com/Morgul/farnsworth/wiki) as places to start.
